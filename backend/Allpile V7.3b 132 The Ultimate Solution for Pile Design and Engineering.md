# Allpile V7.3b 132: A Comprehensive Pile Analysis Software
 
Allpile V7.3b 132 is a Windows-based analysis program that handles virtually all types of piles, including steel pipes, H-piles, pre-cast concrete piles, auger-cast piles, drilled shafts, timber piles, jetted piles, tapered piles, piers with bell, micropiles (minipiles), uplift anchors, uplift plate, and shallow foundations[^1^] [^2^]. It is developed by CivilTech Software, a company that specializes in civil engineering software solutions.
 
One of the major advantages Allpile V7.3b 132 has over other pile software is that it combines most pile analyses in a single program. It calculates compression (with settlement), uplift, lateral capacity, and group analysis all together. Users only need to input the data once instead of several times in different programs. Allpile V7.3b 132 makes pile analysis easy, economical and time-efficient.

Allpile V7.3b 132 is suitable for all engineers, even those without too much pile analysis experience. It helps structural engineers choose soil parameters, and geotechnical engineers choose pile properties. Allpile V7.3b 132 is a must-have tool for structural, geotechnical, and construction engineers.
 
## Features of Allpile V7.3b 132
 
- Smart Data Find: Users only need to input N-value (SPT) or CPT and let program find the remaining data, such as friction, cohesion, density, subgrade reaction coefficient, and P-y parameters. For users with limited field data, it is very useful feature[^2^].
- Graphical Input: The sliding bar and graphical interface change simultaneously with the inputs to illustrate the pile profile. Pile head and load are graphically presented to help users to input data quickly and accurately[^2^].
- Three Ways to Input Soil Properties: Users can input soil properties by either entering N value (SPT or CPT) only and program find all other parameters; entering soil parameters such as C and friction; or entering end bearing and side friction (vertical) or p-y (lateral)[^2^].
- Vertical Capacity: The program evaluates the uplift and compression capacity of the pile. Program provides t-z and q-w analysis. The program also checks torsion (rotation) capacity for single pile[^2^].
- Settlement: The program calculates pile settlement based on point load, skin friction, and shaft compression. It provides Load-Settlement curves[^2^].
- Point of Fixity: Allpile V7.3b 132 determines the Point of Fixity and Stiffness of the pile[^2^].
- Stiffness: Allpile V7.3b 132 determines pile stiffness for rotation, lateral and vertical deflections[^2^].
- Lateral Capacity: Allpile V7.3b 132 performs lateral analysis under different head-load boundary conditions. Deflection, moment, and shear along the entire length of the pile are presented graphically in the report. Program provides p-y analysis[^2^].
- Group Piles Analysis: Both vertical and lateral analyses handle group piles. The loads can be vertical, compression, uplift, shear, and moment. The program calculates lateral movement, rotation, and settlement of the pile cap[^2^].
- Tower Foundation Analysis: Analysis of foundation for transmission towers, wireless antennas, telephone and signal poles, etc[^2^].
- Batter Piles and Sloped Ground: The program can handle batter piles and sloped ground[^2^].
