But how can you master the tracks and win every race in Beach Buggy Racing 2? Here are some tips and tricks that will help you improve your skills and performance in this game:
 
- Master the drift and powerslide. Drifting is a technique that allows you to turn corners without losing speed. To drift, you need to tap and hold the brake button on either side of the screen while steering. This will make your car slide sideways and create sparks. The longer you drift, the more sparks you generate, which will fill up your boost meter. When the meter is full, you can tap it to activate a nitro boost that will give you a burst of speed. Powersliding is similar to drifting, but it involves tapping the brake button repeatedly instead of holding it. This will make your car skid and swerve more unpredictably, which can help you avoid obstacles and powerups from other racers.
- Use the driver's ability at the right time. Each driver has a unique ability that can give you an advantage in the race. For example, Beach Bro can launch beach balls that bounce around and hit other racers, Rez can zap other racers with lightning bolts, and McSkelly can summon a swarm of bats that blind other racers. To use your driver's ability, you need to wait until it charges up and then tap the icon at the top-left corner of the screen. However, you should not use it randomly or waste it. You should use it when you are close to other racers or when you need to catch up or defend yourself.
- Don't fall into the trap. The tracks in Beach Buggy Racing 2 are full of surprises and hazards that can slow you down or knock you out. For example, there are tumbleweeds that roll across the road, birds that drop eggs on your windshield, volcanoes that erupt and spew lava balls, dinosaurs that chase and bite you, and more. You should try to avoid these obstacles as much as possible by steering around them or using powerups to clear them. You should also watch out for powerups from other racers that can affect you negatively, such as oil slicks, fireballs, rockets, ice cubes, etc. You can dodge these by swerving or using shields or magnets.
